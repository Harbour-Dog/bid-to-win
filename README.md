#bid-to-win
A simple strategy bidding game where users can create accounts and have their stats saved.

GAMEPLAY At the beginning of each round, two randomly tricks (between 1 and 10) are generated for them players to bid on. The players can use the buttons in front of them to place their respective bids, but once a button has been used, it isn't available anymore.

The player with the highest bid on a particular trick wins that many points, and the
player with the most points at the end of a game, wins! Each game lasts five rounds.

PLAY VS. COMP GAME MODE In this game mode you play as the Blue Player, against the computer. After committing your selections each round, the computer's bids are revealed and points are assigned normally. This is currently the only mode that records user's stats in the database.

2-PLAYER GAME This game mode is meant to be played by two players using the same device. The Blue Player makes their selections while the Red Player looks away. After the Blue Player commits, their bids are then hidden until both have committed.
